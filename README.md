As a part of Capstone project for Coursera, user wants to open a Chinese restaurant in Washington D.C

Using Foursquare API data we can run analysis on the current businesses in the Washington DC area

Using the explore API and plotting the locations on a map we can see Chinese places are scattered, and have a concentration in Chinatown which makes sense. But there is one area that doesn't seem to have any.. Foggy Bottom. 

Based on the analysis done using Foursquare Data â€“ It was seen that Foggy Bottom could be a good place to invest given the low competition of other Chinese restaurants 
and high margins of traffic. Foggy Bottom has various other establishments and this could be the best way of building a successful Chinese restaurant in the D.C area.
